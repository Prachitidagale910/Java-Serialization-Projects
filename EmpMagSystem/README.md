# Employee Management System (Java Serialization)

## Description
A console-based Employee Management System built using **Java serialization**.  
The system is designed to help HR or small organizations maintain employee records efficiently.  

### Main Functionalities
- **Add Employee:** Store new employee details such as ID, name, and department.  
- **View Employee Records:** Display all saved employee information in a structured format.  
- **Search Employee:** Find employee details using their unique ID.  
- **Save and Load Data:** Persist employee records to a file and retrieve them later using Java serialization.  

## Usage
- Organize and manage employee records in a simple, console-based application.  
- Helps understand how data can be stored and retrieved in Java without using databases.  
- Demonstrates **object serialization**, file handling, and basic Java I/O operations.  

## Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, you will:  
- Understand **Java serialization** and its practical applications in storing object states.  
- Learn to handle **file input/output** in Java.  
- Practice **object-oriented programming** concepts like classes, objects, and modular code structure.  
- Gain experience in creating simple **menu-driven console applications**.  
- Develop skills useful for small-scale management systems in real-world scenarios.  

## Main Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a lightweight system for storing and managing employee data while reinforcing knowledge of **Java serialization, file handling, and object-oriented programming**.  
By completing this project, you get hands-on experience in designing and implementing a **persistent data storage system** in Java.
