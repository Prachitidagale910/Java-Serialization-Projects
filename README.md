# Java Serialization Projects

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to learn more about **Java serialization**, so I decided to try a couple of small projects to practice and understand this concept better.  
These projects helped me learn how to save and load objects in Java, work with files, and create simple console-based applications.  

## Projects in this Folder

1. **Employee Management System**  
   - Add employee records  
   - View employee records  
   - Search employee by ID  
   - Save and load data using Java serialization  

2. **Employee Attendance System**  
   - Add attendance records for employees  
   - View all attendance records  
   - Search attendance by employee ID  
   - Save and load attendance data using Java serialization  

## What I Learned
- How to use **Java serialization** to save and restore objects.  
- Basic **file handling** in Java.  
- How to create **menu-driven console applications**.  
- Understanding **object-oriented programming** concepts better.  

## Purpose
The main goal of these projects was to **practice Java serialization** and get hands-on experience with storing and retrieving data in Java.  
These are small tasks, but they gave me a clear idea of how Java can handle data without a database.  

## Future Plans
I want to try **more projects with serialization**, maybe something bigger like a small management system with multiple features.  

THANK YOU!!
