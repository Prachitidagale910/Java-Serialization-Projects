# Employee Attendance System (Java Serialization)

## Description
A simple console-based Employee Attendance System built in Java using **serialization** to persist data.  
It allows HR managers to maintain attendance records efficiently with the following features:  

- Add new attendance records for employees
- View all attendance records
- Search for an employee by ID
- Save attendance data to a file and load it back

This project demonstrates **object serialization** and basic file handling in Java.

## Features
- Persistent storage using Java Serialization
- Easy console-based menu for user interaction
- Search functionality for quick employee lookup
- Modular code structure with separate classes for Employee and HR Manager

## Usage

* Follow the console menu to add, view, or search attendance records.
* All data is saved automatically using Java serialization.
